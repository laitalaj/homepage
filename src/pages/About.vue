    <h1>About...</h1>
    <h2>...me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a software developer and a master's student in computer science. I
      enjoy board- video- and role playing games, movies, books and music. I'm
      interested in astronomy, machine learning, virtual reality and technology
      in general. Check out my
      <a href="https://github.com/laitalaj/">GitHub</a>
      to see some stuff I've done, and feel free to contact me via
      <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/julius-laitala/">LinkedIn</a>!

    <h2>...this page</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to host some of the
      <router-link :to="{ name: 'pdfs' }">stuff I've written</router-link>
      during my studies, and thought that having a fancy page for that would be
      nice. I decided to learn Vue and Stylus while at it, and I think I like
      them!
